Create shopping lists and share them with your friends.

Supported Platforms: Linux, Android

## Development

The Stack:

* Backend: Springboot + MongoDB
* Web-Frontend: React + Typescript + GraphQL
* App-Frontend: Flutter

### Getting started

Prerequisites:
 * Linux
 * Bash

Lets start with the backend first:


1. Load the gradle project in `backend/` in the IDE of your choice and make sure it compiles.
2. Download and install the comunity version of [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).
3. Open a bash and `cd` into the `backend/` folder.
4. Execute `init_dev_database.sh` to create and initialize the local development database with a test user.
5. Execute `run_dev_database.sh` to start the database.
6. Download and start [Inbucket](https://www.inbucket.org/) and open `http://localhost:9000/monitor` to receive mails sent from the backend.
7. Start the backend with the `localhost` profile.

> Always start the mongo database and the mail server before starting the backend application.

#### Build the flutter frontend application

1. Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
2. Open the flutter project in `flutter_frontend`.
3. Start the application in debug mode.
4. Login with the test user:
   ```
   EMail:    test@test.de
   Password: test
   ```

> In debug mode the application will run against `localhost` where your dev-backend should be running.

##### Code coverage

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/zwohansel/kaufhansel/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/zwohansel/kaufhansel?branch=master)

1. Install lcov
2. In ``flutter_frontend`` run:
   ```
   flutter test --coverage && lcov --remove coverage/lcov.info '*/generated/*' -o coverage/lcov_filter.info && genhtml coverage/lcov_filter.info --output-directory=./coverage/lcov_report
   ```
3. Open ``flutter_frontend/coverage/lcov_report/index.html``

#### Web-Frontend

### Deployment

We use GitHub actions for deployment. 
The workflow files in `.github/workflows` document the deployment process.

To test the backend deployment locally execute `./gradlew -PbackendVersion=<version> bundle` in the root directory (e.g. with `<version>=1.0.0`).
Find the assembled jar file in `backend/build/libs` and run it locally with `java -Dspring.profiles.active=localhost -jar kaufhansel_backend.jar`.
